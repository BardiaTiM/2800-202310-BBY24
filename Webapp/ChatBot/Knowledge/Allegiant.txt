- Optional Services & Fees

- In the case of a flight cancellation, a delay of 30 minutes or more in the planned operation of a flight, or diversion of a flight to an airport other than originally planned, Allegiant will provide notification to affected passengers and to the public within 30 minutes after Allegiant becomes aware of the change.

- * In all cases, notification will be given in the boarding gate area if affected passengers are present in that area, on allegiantair.com, and via Allegiant's Reservations Center upon telephone inquiry by any person.

- Notification may also be given by any of the following methods, whichever is most practical in the circumstances: telephone call, email, written correspondence, airport announcement, on-board announcement or written advisory distributed at airport.

- *Note: If a fight is canceled a week or more before the scheduled date of departure, notification will be provided within 48 hours after the cancellation occurs.

- If a flight is delayed or cancelled for a reason within Allegiant’s control, Allegiant will rebook a Customer on the next available Allegiant flight, or the next available flight on an Allegiant airline partner, at no additional cost to the Customer.

- The next Allegiant flight may originate out of a nearby airport.

- If the Customer chooses not to rebook on another flight, Allegiant will process a full refund back to the original form of payment.

- If a flight is delayed or cancelled for a reason within Allegiant’s control which results in the need for overnight Customer accommodations, Allegiant will provide hotel accommodations when available, or compensation/reimbursement for reasonable overnight accommodation expenses.

- Where a customer seeks reimbursement, they may be asked to provide receipts.
