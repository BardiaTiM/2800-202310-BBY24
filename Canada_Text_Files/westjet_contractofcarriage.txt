the Passenger s travel.

check the instrument on the next available flight.

How does WestJet protect my personal information?
Security
WestJet has sophisticated security measures and procedures in place to help ensure that
your personal information is protected from misuse and from unauthorized access.
However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
We cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us over the internet.
WestJet Domestic Tariff March 13, 2023 P ag e | 132CTA(A) WS2
Retention of information
Personal information collected by WestJet is retained for as long as it is reasonably
required for the purposes for which it was collected, or as permitted or required by law,
following which it is securely destroyed or made anonymous.
Profiling and automated decision making
We use profiling (where an electronic system uses personal information to try and
predict something about you) to provide you with customized experiences and serve you
customized advertising. In most instances where we make a decision about you based
solely on our profiling activities and you do not agree with the decision we have made,
you have the right to request that we perform a manual reassessment of our decision
using the same information.
Apart from as set out above, we do not use profiling or automated decision making
(where an electronic system uses personal information to decide about you without
human intervention).
Cross border transfers of your personal information
We operate and provide products and services to guests located in many different
countries around the world. The global nature of our business means that your personal
information may well be transferred across national boundaries, including, potentially, to
countries that do not require companies to look after your personal information in the
way you have come to expect in your own country. Where we transfer your personal
information across national boundaries, we will protect your personal information by
ensuring that those transfers are made in compliance with all relevant data protection
laws.
If you would like further details of how your personal information is protected when
transferred from one country to another then please email us at privacy@westjet.com.

information?

personal information on your own, and you can opt in or out of features like electronic
communications about seat sales, WestJet Vacations promotional offers and special
offers from our partners.
You can cancel your WestJet Rewards account at any time by contacting us by email.

receive electronic communications about promotions and offers.
