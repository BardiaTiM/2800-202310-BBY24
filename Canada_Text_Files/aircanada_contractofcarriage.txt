(1) A ticket will not be issued and in any case the Carrier will not be obligated to carry until
the passenger has paid the applicable fare or has complied with credit arrangements

Such ticket shall entitle the passenger to transportation only between points of origin
and destination and via the routing designated thereon.

cardholder at the airport any time after ticket issuance including at check-in, prior to

designed to circumvent applicable fare rules.
(2) Where a ticket is not valid as the result of the passenger’s non-compliance with any term
or condition of sale, with this rule or applicable fare rule, or where one or more tickets
have been issued in furtherance of a prohibited practice, Air Canada has the right in its
sole discretion to:
a) Cancel any remaining portion of the passenger’s itinerary or ticket,
b) Confiscate or revoke unused flight coupons
c) Refuse to board the passenger or check-in the passenger or the passenger’s baggage,

the baggage is also overweight and/or oversize.
c) Excess baggage charges will be payable at the point of origin per direction, or at the
point of origin to the point of stopover, in which event, when carriage is resumed
charges will be payable from the point of stopover to the next point of stopover or
destination.
d) When a journey for which a through excess baggage ticket has been issued there is
an increase in the amount of excess baggage carried, the Carrier may issue a separate
excess baggage ticket for such increase and collect charges to destination or a
stopover point, as the case may be.
e) In delivering baggage at the place of departure or at an intermediate stopping place,
or if baggage is lost, the Carrier shall be under no obligation to refund any charge

review its website for more information.
(7) Excess value charges
This rule shall not entitle the passenger to declare such excess value for baggage in
connection with carriage over the Carrier’s route in relation to which the above rule does
not permit such declarations, unless the carriage over such route forms a part of through
carriage including other routes in relation to which such declarations are permitted.
(8) Collection of excess value
Excess value charges will be payable at the point of origin per direction; provided that,
if at a stopover enroute a passenger declares a higher excess value than that originally
declared, additional excess value charges for the increased value from such stopover
point to final destination will be payable.
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 46
(9) Excess baggage and value charges on re-routing or cancellations
When a passenger is rerouted or his carriage cancelled, the provisions which govern with
respect to the payment of additional fares or the refunding of fares shall likewise govern
the payment or the refunding of excess baggage charges and the payment of excess value
charges, but no refund of value charges will be made when a portion of the carriage has
been completed.
(10) Codeshare
In the case of codeshare, the baggage rules of the first marketing Carrier (Carrier whose
code appears on the flight number) may apply, not those of the operating Carrier. If Air
Canada is the first marketing Carrier, its rules shall apply.
(11) Check-in, collection and delivery of checked baggage
a) Check-in
Baggage must be checked at the designated off-site check-in facility or airport in advance
of flight departure time, as prescribed by the check-in time limits set out in RULE 70 –
CHECK-IN AND BOARDING TIME LIMITS.
Carrier shall, upon taking possession of the passenger’s checked baggage, issue a
baggage identification tag for each piece of checked baggage, that will be affixed thereto.
A portion of this baggage identification tag will be provided to the passenger. Any
baggage which passenger intends to take onboard as carry-on baggage and which the
Carrier required passenger to surrender at boarding for placement in the cargo
compartment will be regarded as checked baggage, except for Skycheck baggage
(available on Air Canada Express only, refer to Rule 60(B)(5)). It is passenger’s sole
responsibility to ensure that all checked baggage have passenger’s name or other
personal identification affixed to it.
Baggage will not be checked:
i. To a point that is not on the passenger’s routing, as stated in his/her ticket.
ii. Beyond the passenger’s next point of stopover or, if there is no stopover, beyond the
final destination designated on the ticket.
iii. Beyond a point at which the passenger wants to reclaim the baggage or any portion
thereof.
iv. Beyond the point to which all applicable charges have been paid.
v. Beyond a point at which the passenger is to transfer to a connecting flight if the
Carrier is unable to through-check the baggage, or if that flight is scheduled to
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 47
depart from an airport different from the one at which the passenger is scheduled
to arrive.
b) Collection and delivery of baggage
Checked baggage will be delivered to the bearer of the baggage check upon payment of
all unpaid sums due to the Carrier under contract of carriage or tariff. Only the passenger
for whom a baggage identification tag was issued may take possession of the baggage.
Carrier may, but is under no obligation to do so, require satisfactory proof that the
baggage belongs to the passenger in question before delivering the baggage to the
passenger. Acceptance of the baggage without complaint, within the time limits
stipulated in RULE 105 – LIABILITY OF CARRIERS, by the passenger in possession of
the baggage identification tag is prima facie evidence that the Carrier delivered the
baggage in good condition in accordance with this tariff.
(12) Movement of baggage and delayed baggage
Checked baggage will be carried in the same aircraft as the passenger unless such
carriage is deemed impracticable by the Carrier, in which event the Carrier will move
the baggage on a space available basis, and the checked baggage may arrive after the
passenger’s arrival at destination. Carrier shall make reasonable efforts to deliver
baggage to passenger as soon as practicable, unless restrictions apply pursuant
applicable law or local requirements, such as the need for presence of passenger for
customs clearance. If passenger’s baggage is delayed, the Carrier will provide out-oftown passengers with an over-night kit if required, and will provide information
necessary to allow passenger to obtain updates on the status of their baggage.
B. Acceptance of carry-on baggage
(1) General conditions of acceptance
Carry-on baggage must fit within the size limits set out herein, as it must fit under the
seat located in front of the passenger or in the enclosed storage compartment in the
passenger cabin. Should the carry-on baggage exceed the limits set out herein, the Carrier
may require passenger to check baggage, either at check-in or at boarding.
Note: some exceptions may apply to certain mobility aids and other assistive devices. As
further detailed in this rule, some items are not suitable for carriage, or are subject to
special restrictions and/or fees.
(2) Free baggage allowance
A maximum of 2 pieces of cabin baggage may be carried onto the aircraft by the
passenger. One bag must have total overall dimensions not exceeding 9x15.5x21.5 inches
(23x40x55 cm) except where the under seat space facility requires a bag of a lesser size.
The second bag must have total overall dimensions not exceeding 6x13x17 inches
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 48
(16x33x43 cm). Carry-on baggage must be stored under the seat in front of the passenger
or placed in an enclosed overhead bin.
(3) Musical Instruments
Instruments are accepted as checked baggage, carry-on baggage or cabin-seat baggage –
depending on their size and shape – on flights operated by Air Canada, Air Canada
Express and Air Canada Rouge flights.
String instruments must have their strings loosened to prevent damage caused by
changes in temperature and/or pressure.
a) Instruments that Can Be Brought in the Cabin
Size Restriction
• String instruments (e.g. guitars, violins and violas) can be carried on board – even if
their dimensions slightly exceed Air Canada’s carry-on size requirements - as long as
they fit in the overhead bin or under the seat in front of the passenger, and there is
sufficient space to accommodate the instrument in the cabin at time of boarding. If there
is no space available in the cabin to securely store the instrument according to airline
staff, the instrument may need to be checked.
Hard Case
• In case they need to be checked, instruments must always be packaged in a rigid/hard
shell container designed to transport such items.
Allowance
• Instruments can count as part of a passenger’s carry-on baggage allowance provided
they meet the current Air Canada carry-on size requirements of 55 x 40 x 23cm (21.5 x
15.5 x 9in). As such, they can be carried in the cabin as part of, but not in addition to, a
passenger’s carry-on baggage allowance.
Priority Boarding
• Passengers traveling with an instrument may take advantage of pre-boarding between
zones 2 & 3 if they do not already qualify for priority boarding in zones 1 & 2.
Exception
• The number of instruments that can be accommodated on each flight is limited. Some
aircraft have limited onboard storage space, such as on Air Canada Express aircraft
(Beech, CRJ 100/200/705, Dash-8/100, Dash-8/300 and Q400), where instruments may
need to be checked.
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 49
b) Instruments as Checked Baggage
Allowance
If instruments are checked-in, they count as one piece of baggage towards the maximum
number of checked bags allowed by fare type. If the passenger’s bag count (instrument
plus number of other bags to be checked) exceeds the maximum number of items
allowed by fare type, excess checked baggage charges will apply. Baggage restrictions
on dimensions and weight applicable to the fare type will apply to the instrument.
Hard Case
If checked, instruments must always be packaged in a rigid/hard shell container
designed to transport such items.
c) Seat-Loaded Instruments
If a passenger believes that the instrument is too fragile to be handled as checked
baggage or if it exceeds requirements for carry-on baggage, an additional seat may be
purchased for the instrument, subject to seat availability and size restrictions.
Fee/Fare
• The passenger will receive a 50% discount on the lowest available published fare for
the seat-loaded instrument. Taxes, fees and charges may apply.
Reservation Process
• The additional seat must be booked through Air Canada reservations preferably at the
time of booking and at least 48 hours prior to departure.
Allowance
• When a passenger purchases an additional seat for an instrument, Air Canada’s
checked baggage allowance applies per purchased seat, but the carry-on baggage
allowance applies per passenger.
Maximum Dimensions
• The instrument must not exceed 80 lbs (36 kg) in weight and 162.5 cm (64 in) in length.
Exceptions
• Seat-loaded cabin baggage is not available on Beech aircraft and is subject to seating
restrictions on certain aircraft;
• Double basses are not accepted as seat-loaded cabin baggage, but may be checked if
they respect baggage restrictions applicable to the fare type;
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 50
• The 50% discount does not apply to Aeroplan bookings.
Conditions for transportation of a seat-loaded instrument
• Passenger must check-in at least 60 minutes prior to the recommended check-in time.
The passenger must be present at boarding time and inform airline staff of their presence
at the gate to ensure there is enough time for the tie-down process to be completed;
• The instrument must be secured by a tie down system provided by Air Canada to
eliminate shifting of the baggage during normal flight and ground conditions, and
packaged or covered in such a manner as to avoid possible discomfort or injury to
another passenger;
• The instrument must be secured in a seat next to the owner, except if travelling in a
Signature class pod. For passengers travelling in Signature pods, the instrument will be
placed in Premium Economy or Economy Class.
• The instrument must not restrict access to, or use of, any required emergency or regular
exits or aisle of the cabin nor obscure any passenger’s view of seatbelt, no smoking or
exit signs.
d) Passenger Option if Flight Occurs on a Different Aircraft than Expected
If the flight the passenger is booked on occurs on a different aircraft than expected and
there is insufficient stowage space for a musical instrument brought in the cabin under
the conditions set out at section 3a) or c) above, attempts will be made to place the
instrument in the cargo compartment. If there remains insufficient space for the
instrument, Air Canada will, at no additional charge, offer to place the passenger on the
next available flight that can accommodate the passenger and instrument.
(4) Additional items
In addition to the free baggage allowance for carry-on baggage set out in the previous
paragraphs, passengers may bring on-board:
a) Coat or other outer garment;
b) A small purse measuring no more than 25cm x 30cm x 14cm (10in x 12in x 5.5in).
Larger purses will be included in the regular fee baggage allowance for carry-on
baggage;
c) An infant care item (e.g. diaper bag), if passenger is travelling with an infant;
d) A child restraint device if a seat has been purchased for the child/infant;
e) a mobility aid or other assistive devices for stowage or use within the cabin (e.g.
prescription medications or any medical devices needed to administer them such as
 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 51
syringes or auto-injections, vision-enhancing devices, POCS, ventilators and
respirators that use non-spillable batteries, as long as they comply with applicable
safety, security and hazardous materials rules). It is recommended and sometimes
required that passengers contact the Carrier prior to departure to make
arrangements (in particular, but not limited to, for situations where any such aid or
device exceeds the maximum weight or dimensions mentioned above). See RULE
40 – PASSENGERS WITH A DISABILITY for more information, or contact the
Carrier;
f) A small electronic device such as cell phone or mp3 player, but not electronic devices
that can interfere with aircraft navigational and/or communication equipment.
Transmitting and receiving functions must be turned off while on board. Passengers
should contact the Carrier or review its website for more information on these items.
(5) Skycheck Baggage
Skycheck is a baggage service offered on certain Air Canada Express aircraft only (Beech,
CRJ 100/200/705, Dash-8/100, Dash-8/300 and Q400) where onboard storage space is
limited and not all carry-on baggage may be accommodated onboard. Carry-on baggage
is dropped off by the passenger at the aircraft door (if aircraft is parked at a gate) or at
the special cart (next to aircraft stairs) for boarding off the tarmac. Passengers are
encouraged to ensure that their carry-on baggage is identified at all times. For greater
comfort and security, and, when requested by the passenger at the boarding gate, a
Skycheck tag is placed onto each piece of carry-on baggage for which the Skycheck
service will be used. Upon arrival, passenger may retrieve their Skycheck carry-on. This
service is provided for carry-on baggage only. Items that do not conform to the carry-on
dimensions and weights must be checked-in.
C. Prohibited or unacceptable items

(“interlining Carriers“).
 “Selected Carrier” means the Carrier whose baggage rules apply to the entire interline
itinerary.
“Selecting Carrier” means the Carrier whose designator code is identified on the first flight
segment of the passenger’s ticket at the beginning of an interline itinerary issued on a single
ticket whose origin or ultimate destination is in Canada.

Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 61
Where Air Canada is not the Selected Carrier on an interline itinerary but is an Interlining
Carrier that is providing transportation to the passenger based on the ticket issued, Air Canada
will accept and apply as its own the baggage rules of the Selected Carrier throughout the
interline itinerary.
C. Disclosure of baggage rules
For baggage rules provisions related to a passenger’s 1st and 2nd checked bag and the

b) Probation
The Carrier may stipulate that the passenger is to follow certain probationary conditions,
such as not engaging in prohibited conduct, in order for the Carrier to provide transport

Carrier’s liability in case of refusal to carry a passenger for a specific flight or removal of
a passenger enroute for any reason specified in the foregoing paragraphs or in any other
applicable rules shall be limited to the recovery of the refund value of the unused portion

to whom a probation notice is served may provide to the Carrier, in writing, the reasons
why he/she no longer poses a threat to the safety or comfort of passengers or crew, or
to the safety of the aircraft. Such document may be sent to the address provided in the

 CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 70
• As soon as possible when new information is available.
(2) In the event of a Schedule Irregularity that is within Air Canada’s control:

travel needs and chooses to no longer travel, the passenger is entitled to an
Involuntary Refund in accordance with RULE 100 - REFUNDS and compensation
pursuant to APPR if requested within one year of the delay and cancellation;
b) If passenger has been informed of the delay or cancellation less than 12 hours before
the initially scheduled departure, and has been delayed more than two hours after

reasonable quantities, taking into account the length of the wait, the time of day and
the location of the passenger;

other comparable accommodation for out-of-town passengers that is reasonable in
relation to the location of the passenger, as well as transportation to the hotel or
other accommodation and back to the airport, subject to availability;

a delay at arrival of three hours or more, Air Canada will provide compensation in
accordance with APPR. Only the operating carrier will provide compensation;

may be retroactively applied to the sector(s) flown by the passenger. The
cancellation penalty will be deducted from any refundable amount.
(5) At any time cancellation penalties may be applied toward the purchase of a higher Air
Canada fare governed by a different rule from that originally ticketed; providing that
any ticket(s) issued for revised itineraries are annotated “non-ref (amount of cancellation

CTA(A) No. 3
Air Canada Domestic Tariff Page 87
(2) Normal carrier limit of liability will be waived for substantiated claims involving loss
damage or delay in delivery to mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, walkers, crutches,
scooters and other mobility aids, when such items have been accepted into the care of

with any laws, government regulations, orders, or requirements or from failure of
passenger to comply with same.

to perishable items or loss or delay of unsuitably or inadequately packed items, to the
extent that the destruction, loss or damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or
vice of the baggage, or, in case of delay, that the Carrier, its agents, and servants took all
measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was
impossible to take such measures. This exclusion is applicable whether the nonacceptable property is included in the passenger’s checked baggage with or without
