RULE 2: ULTRA LOW COST CARRIER
(A) GENERAL
Flair Airlines Ltd. falls into the small airline category pursuant to Section 1(2) of the APPR.
Carrier services are based on an ultra low cost operational model in order to deliver competitive
prices to Passengers. Except as otherwise provided for expressly under this Tariff, any additional
Passenger protections and compensation shall be limited to amounts which are objectively
commercially reasonable and commensurate with the level of service contracted for by said
Passengers.
All rates and charges published in this Tariff are stated in the lawful currency of Canada, except
where such purchases are made in or are required to be in the currency of another country or state.
Purchases made on board the Carrier's aircraft may not be paid for with cash. Based on the location
of fee payment, conversion to Canadian dollars or to the local currency may occur.
Except as otherwise provided for herein, Carrier may take all reasonable actions whatsoever, within
Carrier's sole and absolute discretion, that may be required from time to time.
RULE 3: APPLICATION OF TARIFF
(A) GENERAL
1. This Tariff is applicable to the transportation of Passengers and their baggage or goods
in scheduled service on aircraft operated by the Carrier. For the avoidance of doubt,
irrespective of the source of ticketing, including where the ticket may have been issued
by a third party travel agent, reseller or indirect air service provider, the terms of this Tariff
remain applicable to the transportation of Passengers and their baggage or goods in
scheduled service on aircraft operated by the Carrier.
2. Scheduled transportation originating in Canada shall be subject to the rules, rates and
charges published or referred to in this Tariff in effect, by virtue of the effective date of
each page.
3. Unless the fare rule governing a specific fare basis code applicable to the transportation
purchased by the Passenger states otherwise, the general rules contained in this Tariff
will apply.
4. The contents of this Tariff are incorporated by reference into the Contract of Carriage.
Should there be a conflict between this Tariff and the Contract of Carriage, or any other
document issued or posted by the Carrier, this Tariff will prevail.
5. The Carrier will be responsible for the furnishing of transportation only over its own lines.
However, when the Carrier issues a ticket, baggage check, or makes any other
arrangements for transportation over the services of any other Carrier (whether or not such
transportation is part of a through service), the Carrier acts only as agent for such other
Carrier and the Tariff of that other Carrier will apply. Flair Air assumes no responsibility for
the acts or omissions of such other Carrier and Carrier shall have no liability whatsoever
for any operations or travel services which are not operated by Carrier, including, and
without limiting the foregoing, where Carrier is acting solely as agent for another travel
service provider with respect to any other travel booking, including travel aboard another
air carrier, and such operations or travel services are subject only to the applicable terms
and conditions imposed by such other travel service provider.

6. No agent, employee or representative of the Carrier has authority to alter, modify or
waive any provisions of the contract of carriage or of this Tariff unless authorized in
writing by an officer of the Carrier.
7. Unless stated otherwise in this Tariff, domestic transportation shall be subject to the
limits of liability in relation to delay or bodily injury which are prescribed under the
Montreal Convention, despite the inapplicability of the Montreal Convention to domestic
transportation.
(B) Gratuitous Carriage
With respect to gratuitous carriage, the Carrier reserves the right to exclude the application of all or
any part of this Tariff.
(C) Change Without Notice
Except as may be required by applicable laws, government regulations, orders and requirements,
the Carrier's rules, regulations and conditions of carriage are subject to change without notice,
provided that no such change shall apply to a contract of carriage after the carriage has
commenced.
(D) Effective Rules, Fares and Charges
1. All carriage of Passengers and/or baggage shall be subject to the Carrier's rules,
regulations, and tariffs in effect on the date of commencement of carriage covered by the
first flight listed on the ticket. Where required by local law or regulation, carriage of
Passengers and/or baggage shall be subject to the Carrier's rules, regulations, and
tariffs in effects on the date of the ticket issuance.
2. No increase in fares or charges applicable to the carriage of Passengers will be collected
in the event that an increase in fares or charges occurs between the time of ticket
issuance and the effective date of any subsequent tariff containing such an increase
provided the confirmed ticketed reservations are not changed and the ticket is not
reissued at the Passenger's request.
(E) Passenger Recourse
Any compensation offered to Passengers is offered pursuant to this Tariff and is, subject to
applicable government regulations, in consideration and settlement of any claims a Passenger may
have against the Carrier, whatsoever. In the case of dispute with the Carrier, Passengers should, as
the first recourse, try to resolve any problem by dealing directly with the Carrier. If the Passenger has
attempted to resolve a complaint with the Carrier and is still not satisfied, the Passenger hereby
agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Canadian Transportation Agency with regards to any
disputes arising from or under this Tariff or a Contract of Carriage, except to the extent such dispute
relates solely to bodily injury or death in which case the appropriate court shall have jurisdiction over
such matter.
(F) Fares Published in Error
From time to time, errors may occur when posting fares (fare in error). A fare in error is one which
the Carrier has, in good faith, mistakenly published and which is clearly erroneous when compared
to fares usually published for a segment.

FLAIR AIRLINES LTD. carying on business as Flair Air CTA (A) No. 5
DOMESTIC SCHEDULED PASSENGER TARIFF Page 15
Issue Date: February 10, 2010
1. The Carrier reserves the right to cancel reservations and/or tickets issued with a quoted
fare in error.
2. The Carrier reserves the right to void the purchased ticket and refund the amount paid by
the Passenger or, if the Passenger agrees to forego the refund, offer the Passenger the
ticket at a published fare that should have been available at time of booking.
3. The Carrier will attempt to notify the Passenger using the contact information provided at
the time of booking:
(i) Within 72 hours after the Carrier becomes aware of the fare in error, that all or
any portion of their ticketed itinerary has been cancelled; or
(ii) At least 24 hours prior to the Passenger's scheduled departure from the point of
origin issued on the ticket, that all or any portion of their ticketed itinerary has
been cancelled, if the ticket was purchased less than 72 hours before their
scheduled departure from the point of origin.
Failure of the Passenger to either acknowledge the contact and/or engage the Carrier with respect to
their position prior to the scheduled departure of the first flight of their itinerary shall be deemed
acceptance by the Passenger that their ticket shall be voided and the purchase value refunded.
(G) Accepted Methods of Payment
All rates and charges in this Tariff are in Canadian Dollars. Purchases made on board the Carrier's
aircraft may not be paid for with cash. Payment may be made using credit cards (VISA®,
Mastercard® or American Express®), debit cards (VISA® Debit or Mastercard® Debit) (where
available) or Vouchers. Only credit card payments are accepted on the Carrier's website and by the
Call Centre. Credit card and bank fees may be charged in some countries in connection with the
purchases made on the Carrier's website. Additional bank fees or credit card fees charged by the
Customer's credit card provider or bank in connection with a purchase will be borne solely by the
Customer. Flair Air charges the exact amount of the price shown at the moment of purchase without
applying any transaction or service fees. Customers are advised to contact card issuer in order to
obtain the nature and the amount of any eventual additional fees before finalizing their purchase. By
finalizing their purchase, the Customer confirms that they have been advised of this. The Carrier
shall not be responsible for any additional fees applied by Customer's card issuer. To avoid
fraudulent purchases, (e.g. due to a lost card or the provision of false information), the Carrier
reserves the right to request additional information from the Customer and/or the cardholder at any
time after a purchase has been made - including at check-in - so that it may verify the information
provided when the purchase was made. Carrier also reserves the right to require another form of
payment should a Customer not be able to accurately provide such additional information.
Furthermore, Carrier reserves the right to cancel a Flight Coupon in case of suspected fraud, theft or
dishonesty. By booking through the Carrier's website, the Customer acknowledges and consents
that the Carrier may, without their signature, draw payment from their credit or debit card to complete
the transaction.
(H) Incorporation by Reference
The obligations of the Carrier under the APPR form part of this Tariff and supersede any
incompatible or inconsistent term and condition of carriage set out in this Tariff to the extent of such
inconsistency or incompatibility, but do not relieve the Carrier from applying terms and conditions of
carriage that are more favourable to the Passenger than the obligations set out in the APPR.

(I) Situations Outside a Carrier's Control

l) an order or instruction from an official of a state or a law enforcement agency or from a person
responsible for airport security.
(J) Diversions
Should a flight be diverted to an alternate airport, Flair Air will proceed to the original intended
destination once the situation has been resolved and the flight has been authorized to proceed. In
some cases, alternates outside of Canada are selected. In these instances, the laws of these
countries may supersede those in Canada. Flair Air accepts no liability for Passengers who may be
detained with the exception of a refund of the unused portion of the ticket.
RULE 4: PROTECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
(A) ACCOUNTABILITY
The Carrier uses contractual means to ensure that the Passenger's personal information is afforded
protection whenever a third party is used to perform services on the Carrier's behalf, including,
without limitation, services relating to information technology, data processing and storage,
research, marketing, conducting surveys and customer relations. In some cases, these third parties
may be located outside Canada and may be required to disclose information to government
authorities in those countries.
Should the Passenger have any questions regarding the Carrier's policy with respect to the
protection of personal information or concerns with respect to the Carrier's handling of personal
information, the Carrier may be contacted at: personalinfo@flyflair.com.
(B) Identifying Purpose of Collection
When a Passenger purchases an airline ticket or makes a flight booking, or when a third party does
so on the Passenger's behalf, the Carrier will require that certain personal information related to the
Revision 1
Effective: February 11, 2020
FLAIR AIRLINES LTD. carying on business as Flair Air CTA (A) No. 5
DOMESTIC SCHEDULED PASSENGER TARIFF Page 17
Issue Date: February 10, 2010
Passenger be provided to complete the transaction. This may include, at the Carrier's sole and
absolute discretion, the Passenger's name, gender, address, email address, telephone number, and
information related to the Passenger's form of payment. This information is required to identify the
Passenger, in order to contact the Passenger, and to complete the purchasing process. The Carrier
may use this information for any purposes, whether related to commercial or operational
requirements, or otherwise, including with regards to any current and future bookings made by a
Passenger or any third party acting on their behalf.
To the extent that the Passenger fails to provide adequate and/or accurate information to the Carrier,
the Carrier is not liable for any damages which result from the Passenger not receiving
communication from the Carrier including communications relating to, among other things, Schedule
Irregularities.
(C) Information Required By Government Authorities
There may be situations in which the Carrier is required by government authorities to collect, use or
disclose personal information about a Passenger, without the Passenger's knowledge or consent.
Information that Carriers are required to collect by government authorities, as a result of the
Passenger's boarding location and destination, may include: the Passenger's full name; date of
birth; citizenship; gender; passport number and country of issuance; visa number (including ETA or
ESTA information); permanent resident card number; the means by which the Passenger paid for
their flight; details as to how it was booked; and any other personal information collected by the
Carrier as set out in this policy or as required by such government authority.
(D) Information Collected for Additional Services or Marketing and Related Purposes
When the Carrier is requested to provide additional services, for example, the provision of special
meals, oxygen or stretcher services, or the accommodation for Passengers with disabilities, etc., the
Carrier or their agent may collect additional personal information not otherwise required.
Personal information collected from Passengers may also be used for marketing and related
purposes.
(E) Consent
The Carrier will collect, use and disclose personal information about the Passenger with the
Passenger's knowledge and consent, unless otherwise required or allowed by law. Prior to collecting
personal information, the Carrier will identify the purposes for doing so and limit the collection, use
and disclosure of personal information to those purposes.
Generally, the Carrier will collect personal information from the Passenger, and use it and disclose it
with consent received from the Passenger or from someone on the Passenger's behalf.
There may be certain circumstances where personal information can be collected, used, or
disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Passenger. For example, legal, medical, or
security reasons may make it impossible or impractical to seek consent. When information is being
collected for the detection and prevention of fraud or for law enforcement, seeking the consent of the
Passenger might defeat the purpose of collecting the information. Seeking consent may be
impossible or inappropriate when the Passenger is a minor, seriously ill, or has a mental health
condition.

Issue Date: February 10, 2010
(F) Third Party Bookings and Changes to Bookings
If a third party, including a family member, friend, or work colleague, seeks to make a booking on a
Passenger's behalf, that third party may be asked to provide the Carrier with the same personal
information that the Carrier would normally collect from the Passenger directly in order to complete
the transaction. Unless and until the Carrier is advised otherwise, the Carrier considers that such a
third party has the Passenger's consent and authorization to provide the Carrier with the
Passenger's personal information and make bookings (and changes thereto) on the Passenger's
behalf in accordance with the Carrier's privacy policy set out in this Tariff. Please note that the
collection, use and disclosure of the Passenger's personal information by a third party is subject to
the Passenger's dealings with the third party and any applicable privacy policies and practices the
third party may have.
If a third party who has booked the Passenger's current flight or other travel service or who
otherwise has the Passenger's full name and booking reference, contacts the Carrier and seeks
information on the Passenger's booking or wishes to make changes to it, the Carrier will disclose the
Passenger's booking information. The Carrier may, in its sole and absolute discretion, allow such
third party to make changes to the Passenger's booking, to the extent any such changes are allowed
under the Contract of Carriage, and the Carrier is acting reasonably where it concludes that the
Passenger has given the third party their consent to do so. If the Passenger does not want a third
party to be able to obtain information on or make changes to the Passenger's booking, the

permitted for musical instruments for safety reasons. Musical instruments may be accepted as
Checked Baggage pursuant to the terms and restrictions contained in this Tariff.

(substitution), the Carrier may deny carriage of musical instruments should the replacement aircraft
be unable to accommodate certain instruments, or the policies of a replacement Carrier differ from

refuse to transport a person solely based on their disability. In instances when refusing
transportation to a person with a disability is necessary, the Carrier will provide an explanation to the

DOMESTIC SCHEDULED PASSENGER TARIFF Page 36
Issue Date: February 10, 2010
(B) Acceptance of Declaration of Self Reliance
Except for applicable safety related rules and regulations, the Carrier will accept the determination
made by or on behalf of a person with a disability as to self reliance. Once advised that they are "self
reliant," the Carrier will not refuse such Passenger transportation on the basis that the person with a
disability is not accompanied by a personal attendant or based on the assumption that the
Passenger may require assistance from airline employees in meeting the Passenger's needs, such
as assistance with eating, using the washroom facilities or administering medication which are
beyond the range of services that are normally offered by the Carrier.
(C) Medical Clearance
The Carrier will not automatically require a medical clearance for persons with disabilities as a
condition of travel. Rather, the Carrier may, in good faith and using its reasonable discretion,
determine that a person with a disability requires medical clearance where their safety or wellbeing,
in terms of such things as assistance with eating, using the washroom facilities, or that of other
Passengers is in question. Where the Carrier refuses to transport a Passenger for such reasons, a
written explanation must be provided at the time of refusal. When medical clearance is required, the
Carrier may assess a person's fitness to travel based on information and/or documentation
submitted by the person with a disability (such as a note from the person's physician or healthcare
professional).
(D) Advance Notice
Where a Passenger requests a service set out in this Rule at least 36 hours prior to departure, the
Carrier will provide the service if the Carrier has confirmed such service will be provided. Such
requests should be made by the Passenger at the time of reservation, and as far in advance of travel
as possible. Where a Passenger requests a service less than 36 hours prior to departure, the Carrier
will make a reasonable effort to provide the service.
(E) Seating Restrictions and Assignments
When a person identifies the nature of their disability, the Carrier will inform the Passenger of the
available seats that are most accessible and then establish with that Passenger an appropriate seat
assignment. Passengers with a disability will not be permitted to occupy seats in designated
emergency exit rows, or otherwise in accordance with applicable safety related rules and
regulations. Persons with disabilities and their attendants, who will meet the persons' disability
related needs, will be seated together. Attendants are required to have a valid flight voucher and are
treated in all other respects as a Passenger.
(F) Acceptance of Assistive Aids
The Carrier will permit Passengers to check in their manual or electric (battery-powered)
wheelchairs or mobility aids, free of charge, in addition to the checked baggage allowance,
regardless of the fare type purchased provided that:
a) the design of the aircraft permits carriage of the mobility aid;
b) in the case of electrical devices, the batteries meet the requirements set out in IATA Dangerous
Goods Regulations;
c) the assistive device is of a type as described in Rule 14(G).

d) The assembling and disassembling of assistive devices will be provided by the Carrier, except
that such assistance will not be considered to have occurred during the carriage. In the event
that any damage or loss to such assistive device as a result of the assembly and disassembly,
the Carrier shall not be liable for such damage or the replacement cost of such assistive device,
except if the Passenger can establish gross negligence on the part of the Carrier or its agents.
Where possible, the Carrier will allow persons with disabilities to retain any items outlined in
Rule 14(G) at their seat.
Where space permits, the Carrier will, without charge, permit the person to store a manually
operated folding wheelchair and small aids in the passenger cabin during the flight.
Wheelchairs and assistive devices will be the last items to be stowed in the aircraft hold and the first
items to be removed.
NOTE: For provisions related to limitations of liability regarding loss of, damage to, or delay in
delivering mobility aids, refer to Rule 25(D)11.
(G) Manually Operated Wheelchair Access
The Carrier will permit the person who uses a manually operated wheelchair to remain in the
wheelchair to the extent practicable.
(H) Service Animals
The Carrier will accept for transportation, without charge, a service animal required to assist a
person with a disability provided that the animal is properly harnessed and certified in writing as
having been trained by a professional service animal institution. These documents must be
submitted in accordance with Rule 17(D).
The Passenger must declare to the Carrier the breed of the service animal and its approximate
dimensions and weight. For the comfort of all Passengers, the Carrier or their agent will determine,
in consultation with the person with the disability, where the person and Service Animal will be
seated. The Carrier will assign a seat to the person, provided that the Carrier has been notified in
advance, which provides sufficient space for the person and the service animal and the Carrier will
permit the service animal to accompany the person on board the aircraft, and to remain on the floor
at the person's passenger seat. Where there is insufficient floor space in the seat row of the person's
passenger seat, the Carrier will permit the service animal to remain on the floor in an area where the
person can still exercise control over the animal.
Service animals that are causing a disruption, including barking, chirping, howling, growling, or other
disruptive occurrences, in the Carrier's sole and absolute discretion, may be denied carriage. The
Passenger assumes full responsibility for the service animal and shall make all necessary
arrangements to obtain valid health and vaccination certificates, entry permits, and other documents
required by countries, states or territories for entry or transit. In the absence of such documentation,
the service animal will not be accepted for carriage.
(I) Emotional Support Animals
Emotional support animals limited to domestic dogs and cats will be permitted at the discretion of the
Carrier and subject to applicable fees. The Carrier will require a note from a doctor, licensed to
practise by a self-regulatory College of Physicians and Surgeons, or other comparable regulator, in

The Passenger is required to deliver to the office of the Carrier confirmation of training, signed by the
owner and/or trainer of the animal, confirming the animal will behave appropriately in a public setting.
Emotional support animals must not be larger than to permit the animal to either rest on the
Passenger's lap or under the seat.
(J) Services to be Provided to Persons With Disabilities
The Carrier will make best efforts to ensure that services are provided to persons with disabilities
when a request for such services is made at least 72 hours prior to departure. The Carrier will make
reasonable efforts to accommodate requests not made within this time limit. Services to be provided
upon request will include:
1. assisting with registration at the check-in counter;
2. assisting in proceeding to the boarding area; the Carrier will not be able to have a
representative stay with the Passenger at all times; once at the departure gate, a

baggage, the Carrier will allow the person, upon request, to board the aircraft in advance of other
Passengers, where time permits. The Carrier may also require a person, even in the absence of a
request to do so, to board the aircraft in advance of other Passengers in order that it has enough
time to provide the requested assistance.
(L) Communication and Confirmation of Information
Announcements to Passengers concerning stops, delays, schedule changes, connections, onboard
services and claiming of baggage will be made in visual, verbal and/or written format (including
Braille) to persons with disabilities who request such a service.

itinerary, including connection time, check-in and travel buffer. The ability to recharge the
battery during connection is not available.

2. In such instances, the Carrier will:
a) carry the Passenger on another of its Passenger aircraft on which space is available
without additional charge; or, at the Carrier's option
b) reroute the Passenger to the destination named on the ticket or applicable portion
thereof by its own or other transportation services; and if the fare for the revised

damage or delay of baggage, whether checked or unchecked and such liability shall
be further limited to the reasonable replacement costs of the destroyed, lost,

DOMESTIC SCHEDULED PASSENGER TARIFF Page 58
Issue Date: February 10, 2010
c) unchecked baggage, including personal items, shall be considered to be the

3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Carrier accepts carriage of baggage
beyond the applicable check-in deadline, whether or not such acceptance is subject to
applicable fees, the Carrier shall not be liable for any delay of such baggage which

Carrier. Assistance offered to the Passenger by the Carrier or their agents in loading,
unloading or transferring unchecked baggage shall be considered as complimentary

baggage incurred during, or as a result of, this service, unless such damage is caused
by the negligence of the Carrier or their agents.

to, checked baggage upon condition only that the event which caused the destruction,
loss or damage took place on board the aircraft or during any period within which the
checked baggage was in the charge of the Carrier. However, the Carrier is not liable if
and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the
baggage.
4. The Carrier is not liable for damage to the Passenger's baggage caused by contents of
the Passenger's baggage. Any Passenger whose property causes damage to another
Passenger's baggage or to the property of the Carrier will compensate the Carrier for all
losses and expenses it incurs as a result.

treatment of perishable items or fragile articles, it shall not be liable for spoilage resulting
from the delay in delivery of any perishable items described in Rule 13, nor for the
damage to, or damage caused by, fragile articles described in Rule 13 which are

claims involving the loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of assistive aids, when such
items have been accepted as checked baggage or otherwise. In the event that aa

replacement value of the assistive aid. In the event that a an assistive aid is lost or
damaged:

rule.

a) If, due to a schedule irregularity within the Carrier's control or denied boarding in
accordance with the Tariff, the Passenger chooses to no longer travel due to loss of
purpose of travel or if alternate travel could not be provided within a reasonable
time, the Carrier will offer a refund equal to the fare and charge paid, irrespective if
travel has commenced.
b) If, due to a schedule irregularity within the Carrier's control or denied boarding in
accordance with the Tariff, the Passenger chooses to no longer travel because the
alternate transportation offered does not meet with the Passenger's satisfaction, the
Carrier will offer a refund equal to the unused portion of the purchaser's ticket.
c) If, due to a schedule irregularity not within the Carrier's control or a refusal to
transport in accordance with the Tariff, no portion of a ticket has been used, the
amount of refund will be equal to the fare and charges paid; or
d) If, due to a schedule irregularity not within the Carrier's control or a refusal to
transport in accordance with the Tariff, a portion of the ticket has been used, the
amount refunded to the purchaser will be the one that results in the most generous
amount using one of the following methods:
(i) The difference between the fare paid and the fare for transportation actually
used or to be used; or
(ii) Provided that the point where travel terminated was on the Passenger's routing
as shown on the original ticket and the routing remains unchanged, the
Passenger will be refunded the difference between the one-way fare applicable
to the unused transportation from the point where the Passenger terminated
travel to the destination or next stopover point as named on the ticket, or to the
point at which transportation is to be resumed less the same rate of discount, (if
travel is on a discount fare) that was applied to the original one-way fare
(including all charges). If the Passenger was travelling on a round trip, the
amount refunded would be based on the rate of discount of one half of the
round trip fare; or,
(iii) If the point where the Passenger terminated travel was not on the routing
specified on the ticket, the refund will be based on the lowest applicable fare of
the Carrier operating between the point where the Passenger terminated travel
to the destination or next stopover point named on the ticket or to the point at
which transportation is to be resumed.
3. Involuntary refund of tickets shall be made in the currency used to issue the ticket and in
the country where the ticket was purchased, whenever possible. However, Canadian
dollar refunds or refunds in the currency of the country where the involuntary refund is
necessary may be made at the request of the Passenger provided a refund in such
currency is not prohibited by local government foreign exchange control regulations.
