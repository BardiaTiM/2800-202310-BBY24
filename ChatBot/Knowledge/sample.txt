Properly accommodating passenger with disabilities and other special needs, including during tarmac delays:
- Allegiant consulted with organizations representing persons with disabilities in the United States when developing training programs, policies and procedures for undertaking the requirements of 14 CFR Part 382, the DOT regulations implementing the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA).

- We strive especially to ensure that customers with disabilities who identify themselves as needing special or additional assistance receive services in compliance with Part 382 and ACAA.

- This commitment includes services and assistance provided during lengthy tarmac delays.

Meeting customers' essential needs during lengthy tarmac delays (Contingency Plan):
- Should an unusual event result in a lengthy onboard delay, we want to ensure the safety and well-being of our customers and crew.

- If the aircraft is delayed on the tarmac, without access to a terminal gate, for more than three hours (four hours in the case of an international flight), we will implement our Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays will have been implemented to ensure we meet our customers' essential needs.

- A tarmac delay is defined as the time after leaving the gate or upon landing without access to the terminal.

- Our Manager of Customer Operations will work with the affected airport and in-flight teams to implement the plan which may include the participation of local airport authorities and other carriers.

- We make every reasonable effort to avoid lengthy delays on the tarmac and elsewhere.

- However, if circumstances cause a tarmac delay longer than two (2) hours, we will meet our customers' essential needs by offering complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and snack service; restroom facilities and basic medical assistance will be available throughout any tarmac delay.

- These services will be offered as long as the captain of the flight determines there is no safety- or security-related reason that precludes the services.

- For tarmac delays covered by our contingency plan that last longer than three hours (four hours in the case of an international flight), our Manager of Customer Operations, the local airport and the captain of the flight along with the FAA, air traffic control and airport operations personnel will determine necessary airport terminal access, secure aircraft parking, ground service equipment, personnel, supplies, services and communications ensuring the safety of all involved and the ability of passengers then desiring to deplane to do so.      

- Every Allegiant captain in conjunction with Allegiant's Dispatch Department will work to evaluate a given situation and use their collective best judgment to respond to any emergency or other extraordinary circumstance which may arise.

- This may involve seeking the assistance of qualified medical personnel onboard the aircraft, expediting the aircraft's safe return to a terminal gate, use of the onboard medical kit, consulting with Medlink (a medical advisory group), and/or requesting additional medical assistance and support.

Handling "bumped" passengers with fairness and consistency in case of an overbooked flight:
- In the event of an overbooking situation, or our inability to accommodate a confirmed passenger due to an unusable seat (for example, the seat is broken and cannot safely be occupied), we will actively solicit volunteers to accept denied boarding and will involuntarily deny boarding only as a last resort.

- See Section 105 of Allegiant's Contract of Carriage for information on denied boarding compensation.

- If unsuccessful in soliciting enough volunteers and we need to involuntarily deny boarding to one or more passengers, consistent with our Contract of Carriage and Part 250 of the DOT regulations, we will advise passengers of their options, including the amount of compensation payable.

- If there are still not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with Allegiant Air's boarding priority.

- Under DOT Part 250, a passenger who is denied boarding involuntarily and who is eligible for involuntary denied boarding compensation must be told that he or she is eligible for a compensation payment to be issued on the day and place the denied boarding occurs or, if Allegiant arranges alternate transportation that departs before the payment can be prepared and tendered, within 24 hours.

- If the carrier chooses to also offer the option of a travel voucher, it must be made clear to the passenger that the choice between the payment and the travel voucher is up to the passenger, not the carrier.

- Allegiant shall furnish passengers who are denied boarding involuntarily from flights on which they hold confirmed reserved space immediately after the denied boarding occurs, a written statement explaining the terms, conditions, and limitations of denied boarding compensation, and describing the carrier's boarding priority rules and criteria.

- Allegiant shall also furnish the statement to any person upon request at all airport ticket selling positions and at all boarding locations being used by the carrier.
